# Sorting-Algorithms
A Java Class that contains different methods for sorting ArrayLists using many different
Sorting Algorithms. This was a class project, and I was given an interface for it. So the method
signatures are not my own, they were given to me. I simply implemented the algorithms.
<b> The Quicksort algorithm doesn't work yet! This is still a work in progress. </b>
